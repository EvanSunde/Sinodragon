# Refactoring of Keyboard Configuration Application

This document explains the refactoring of the keyboard configuration application, which was previously organized within a single large file (`keyboard_layout.py`), into a modular, maintainable structure.

## Directory Structure

The application has been reorganized into the following structure:

```
keyboard/
├── main.py                 # Application entry point
├── keyboard_controller.py  # Hardware communication logic
├── config_manager.py       # Configuration management
├── shortcut_manager.py     # Shortcut key management
├── shortcut_lighting.py    # Shortcut lighting logic
├── ui/                     # User interface components
│   ├── __init__.py         # Package exports
│   ├── key_button.py       # KeyButton widget
│   ├── color_display.py    # ColorDisplay widget
│   ├── keyboard_layout.py  # Keyboard layout widget
│   ├── control_panel.py    # Control panel widget
│   ├── main_window.py      # Main application window
│   ├── key_mapping.py      # Qt key mappings
│   ├── event_handler.py    # Custom event handling
│   └── dialogs/            # Dialog components
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── shortcut_editor.py
│       ├── modifier_colors.py
│       └── application_shortcuts.py
├── utils/                  # Utility functions
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── system_monitor.py   # System monitoring utilities
└── features/               # Application features
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── text_display.py     # Text display feature
    ├── effects.py          # Visual effects
    ├── app_shortcuts.py    # Application-specific shortcuts
    ├── system_monitor.py   # System monitoring feature
    └── cli.py              # Command-line interface
```

## Key Components

1. **Main Window (`ui/main_window.py`)**
   - Main application window
   - Handles application lifecycle
   - Coordinates all components

2. **Keyboard Layout (`ui/keyboard_layout.py`)**
   - Visual representation of the keyboard
   - Handles key button creation and layout
   - Manages brightness controls

3. **Control Panel (`ui/control_panel.py`)**
   - UI controls for configuring the keyboard
   - Color selection, region selection, presets, etc.

4. **UI Components**
   - `KeyButton`: Individual keyboard keys
   - `ColorDisplay`: Color preview widget
   - Various dialogs for configuration

5. **Features**
   - Text display, effects, app shortcuts, etc.
   - Each feature is encapsulated in its own module

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Improved Maintainability**
   - Easier to locate and modify specific functionality
   - Reduced file size makes code more manageable
   - Better separation of concerns

2. **Enhanced Readability**
   - Clear component boundaries
   - Focused modules with specific responsibilities
   - Reduced cognitive load when working with the codebase

3. **Better Testability**
   - Components can be tested in isolation
   - Clearer interfaces between modules
   - Easier to mock dependencies

4. **Eased Future Development**
   - New features can be added with minimal changes to existing code
   - UI and logic are properly separated
   - Component reuse is facilitated

## Usage

The application can be run as before using:

```bash
python main.py
```

The refactoring maintains all existing functionality while providing a more organized and maintainable codebase.
